## Python Developer Guide

The Abseil Python Developer Guide provides programming documentation for the
Abseil Python code on https://github.com/abseil/abseil-py. Much of the code
within that repository is heavily documented. This guide is designed to augment
those code comments. For full reference documentation, consult the source files
directly.
