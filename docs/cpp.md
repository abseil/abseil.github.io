## C++ Developer Guide

The Abseil C++ Developer Guide provides programming documentation for
the Abseil C++ code on
[https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp).
Much of the code within that repository is heavily documented; all public API
header files include thorough documentation. This guide is designed
to augment those code comments. For full reference documentation, consult
the header files directly.
