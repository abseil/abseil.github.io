# C++ Developer Guide

The Abseil C++ Developer Guide provides programming documentation for
the Abseil C++ code on
[https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp).
Much of the code within that repository is heavily documented; all public API
header files include thorough documentation. This guide is designed
to augment those code comments. For full reference documentation, consult
the header files directly.

* [C++ Quickstart (Bazel)](/docs/cpp/quickstart)
* [C++ Quickstart (CMake)](/docs/cpp/quickstart-cmake)
* [C++ Programming Guides](/docs/cpp/guides/)
* [C++ Platforms Guide](/docs/cpp/platforms/)
* [C++ Tools Guide](/docs/cpp/tools/)

The following guides are general programming guides that we think are useful
to C++ developers:
