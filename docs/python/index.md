## Python Developer Guide

The Abseil Python Developer Guide provides programming documentation for the
Abseil Python code on
[https://github.com/abseil/abseil-py](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-py). Much
of the code within that repository is heavily documented. This guide is designed
to augment those code comments. For full reference documentation, consult the
source files directly.
