Many of you asked for a new joining API and we heard you. We now have one
joining function to replace them all, and it is spelled `absl::StrJoin()`.
You simply give it a collection of objects to be joined and a separator
 string, and it does the rest. It will work with collections of `std::string`,
`absl::string_view`, `int`, `double` -- any type that `absl::StrCat()`
supports. If you need to join a type that will not `StrCat()`, you can
also provide a custom `Formatter` for that type; we'll see below how the
use of a `Formatter` will let us nicely join a map.

Now for some quick examples:

```c++
std::vector<std::string> v = {"a", "b", "c"};
std::string s = absl::StrJoin(v, "-");
// s == "a-b-c"

std::vector<absl::string_view> v = {"a", "b", "c"};
std::string s = absl::StrJoin(v.begin(), v.end(), "-");
// s == "a-b-c"

std::vector<int> v = {1, 2, 3};
std::string s = absl::StrJoin(v, "-");
// s == "1-2-3"

const int a[] = {1, 2, 3};
std::string s = absl::StrJoin(a, "-");
// s == "1-2-3"
```

The following example passes a `Formatter` argument to format the pairs in a
map, using a different separator. This makes the output nice and readable.

{% raw %}
```cpp
std::map<std::string, int> m = {{"a", 1}, {"b", 2}, {"c", 3}};
std::string s = absl::StrJoin(m, ";", absl::PairFormatter("="));
// s == "a=1;b=2;c=3"
```
{% endraw %}

You can also pass a C++ lambda expression as a `Formatter`.

```cpp
std::vector<Foo> foos = GetFoos();

std::string s = absl::StrJoin(foos, ", ", [](std::string* out, const Foo& foo) {
  absl::StrAppend(out, foo.ToString());
});
```

Please refer to [absl/strings/str_join.h][str_join] for more details.
