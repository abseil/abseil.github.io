*Are nulls really a billion-dollar mistake?*

## The problem

Let's say you need to implement a function with a parameter that may or may not
exist. You might be tempted to use modern, fancy-schmancy `absl::optional` for
this. However, if the object is big enough that it should be passed by
reference, `absl::optional` is probably not what you want. Consider the
following two declarations:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-cpp bad-code">
void MyFunc(const absl::optional&lt;Foo&gt;& foo);  // Copies by value
void MyFunc(absl::optional&lt;const Foo&&gt; foo);  // Doesn't compile
</pre>

The first option probably doesn't do what you want. If someone passes a `Foo`
into `MyFunc`, the `Foo` will be copied *by value* into the
`absl::optional<Foo>`, which will then be passed by reference into the function.
If your goal was to avoid copying the `Foo`, you haven't.

The second option would be great, but unfortunately is not supported by
`absl::optional`.

## Recommendation

If you need a parameter that might not exist, pass it by `const *` and let
`nullptr` indicate "does not exist."

<pre class="prettyprint lang-cpp code">
void MyFunc(const Foo* foo);
</pre>

This will be just as efficient as passing by `const Foo&`, but supports null
values.

The documentation for `std::optional` points out that you can use a
`std::reference_wrapper` to work around the fact that optional references aren't
supported:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-cpp code">
void MyFunc(absl::optional&lt;std::reference_wrapper&lt;const Foo&gt;&gt; foo);
</pre>

However, this has quite a lot of boilerplate, and is difficult to read.
Therefore, we don't recommend it.

### Then what on Earth is <code>absl::optional</code> for???

`absl::optional` can be used if you *own* the thing that's optional. For
example, class members and function return values often work well with
`absl::optional`. If you don't own the thing that's optional, just use a
pointer, as described above.

### Exceptions

If your object is small enough to not need pass-by-reference, you may take the
object wrapped in an `absl::optional` by value. For example:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-cpp code">
void MyFunc(absl::optional&lt;int&gt; bar);
</pre>

If you expect all callers of your function to already have an object inside of
an `absl::optional`, then you may take a `const absl::optional&`. However, this
is rare; it usually only occurs if your function is private within your own
file/library.
