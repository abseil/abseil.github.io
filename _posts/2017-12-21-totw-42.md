*"The man who builds a factory builds a temple; the man who works there worships
there, and to each is due, not scorn and blame, but reverence and praise." --
Calvin Coolidge*

One of the main difficulties with writing constructors in C++ (at Google) is
that they effectively must succeed, because they have no way to report failure
to the caller. (Google's C++ style forbids exceptions.) You can use an
`abort()`, of course, but doing so crashes the whole program, which is often
 unacceptable in production code.

If your class’s initialization logic can’t avoid the possibility of failure, one
common approach is to give the class an initializer method (also called an "init
method"), which performs any initialization work that might fail, and signals
that failure via its return value. The assumption is usually that the user will
call this method immediately after construction, and if it fails the user will
immediately destroy the object. However, these assumptions are not always
documented, nor always obeyed. It’s all too easy for users to start calling
other methods before initialization, or after initialization has failed.
Sometimes the class actually encourages this behavior, e.g. by providing methods
to configure the object before initializing it, or to read errors out of it
after initialization fails.

This design commits you to maintaining a class with at least two distinct
user-visible states, and often three: initialized, uninitialized, and
initialization-failed. Making such a design work requires a lot of discipline:
every method of the class has to specify what states it can be called in, and
users have to comply with these rules. If this discipline lapses, client
developers will tend to write whatever code happens to work, regardless of
what you intended to support. When that starts to happen, maintainability
nosedives, because your implementation has to support whatever combinations of
pre-initialization method calls your clients have started to depend on. In
effect, your implementation has become your interface.

Fortunately, there’s a simple alternative that lacks these drawbacks: provide a
*factory function* which creates and initializes instances of your class, and
returns them by pointer, using null to indicate failure. Here’s a toy example:

```c++
// foo.h
class Foo {
 public:
  // Factory method: creates and returns a Foo.
  // May return null on failure.
  static std::unique_ptr<Foo> Create();

  // Foo is not copyable.
  Foo(const Foo&) = delete;
  Foo& operator=(const Foo&) = delete;

 private:
  // Clients can't invoke the constructor directly.
  Foo()
};

// foo.c
std::unique_ptr<Foo> Foo::Create() {
  // Note that since Foo's constructor is private, we have to use new.
  return absl::WrapUnique(new Foo());
}
```

In many cases, this pattern gives you the best of both worlds: the factory
function `Foo::Create()` exposes only fully-initialized objects like a
constructor, but it can indicate failure like an initializer method. Another
advantage of factory functions is that they can return instances of any subclass
of the return type. This allows you to swap in a different implementation
without updating user code, or even choose the implementation class dynamically,
based on user input.

The primary drawback of this approach is that it returns a pointer to a
heap-allocated object, so it’s not well-suited for "value-like" classes designed
to work on the stack. However, such classes usually don’t require complex
initialization in the first place. Factory functions also can’t be used when a
derived class constructor needs to initialize its base, so initializer methods
are sometimes necessary in the protected API of a base class. The public API can
still use factory functions, though.
