**I love Mozart, but I often make a terrible hash of it.** -- *Simon Rattle*

The `absl::Hash` framework [go/absl-hash] is now the default hash implementation
for the Swisstable family of hash tables (`absl::{flat,node}_hash_{set,map}`).
All types hashable by this framework will automatically be useable as keys in
Swisstables.

## How Do I Use It?

Let's say we have a simple `Song` struct (let's agree that a song can be
uniquely identified by these fields):

<pre class="prettyprint lang-cpp code">
struct Song {
  std::string name;
  std::string artist;
  absl::Duration duration;
};
</pre>

and we want to be able to store an `absl::flat_hash_set&lt;Song&gt;` or an
`absl::flat_hash_map&lt;Song, CopyrightOwner&gt;`. All we have to do is add a simple
friend function like:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-cpp code">
struct Song {
  std::string name;
  std::string artist;
  absl::Duration duration;

  template &lt;typename H&gt;
  friend H AbslHashValue(H h, const Song& s) {
    return H::combine(std::move(h), s.name, s.artist, s.duration);
  }

  // operator == and != omitted for brevity.
};
</pre>

and everything will work!

## How Do I Test It?

We provide `absl::VerifyTypeImplementsAbslHashCorrectly` to verify that a type
implements its overload correctly. This function has a few requirements:

*   The type must implement the `==` operator correctly.

*   The caller must provide instances of the type that include any interesting
    representations for their type. (For example, a type with a small size
    optimization should include equivalent instances that use the small size
    optimization and that do not.)

<pre class="prettyprint lang-cpp code">
TEST(MyType, SupportsAbslHash) {
  EXPECT_TRUE(absl::VerifyTypeImplementsAbslHashCorrectly({
      MyType(),
      MyType(1, 2),
      MyType(2, 3),
      MyType(0, 0),
  }));
}
</pre>

`absl::VerifyTypeImplementsAbslHashCorrectly` also supports testing heterogenous
lookup and custom equality operators.
