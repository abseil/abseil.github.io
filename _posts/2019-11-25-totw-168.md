```
inline constexpr absl::string_view kHelloWorld = "Hello World.";
```

Safety of initialization and destruction is ensured by the use of `constexpr`,
and using `inline` here ensures that there is only one copy of `kHelloWorld` in
the program.

Using the keyword `inline` here may seem strange at first, particularly if you
are used to thinking of `inline` as being primarily an optimization hint. The
use of `inline` for functions in headers is a close analogy; compare the
variable definition above to something like

```
inline constexpr absl::string_view HelloWorld() {
  return "Hello World.";
}
```

but with the advantage that the string is guaranteed to be at the same memory
address every time.

Almost every global variable defined in a header file should be marked as
`inline` -- and should generally be `constexpr` too. If they are not marked as
`inline` then there will be a separate instance of the variable for each .cc
file that includes the header, which can lead to subtle violations of the ODR
(one definition rule).

Outside of header files there is no need to mark variables as `inline`.

Note: A `static constexpr` data member of a class is _implicitly_ `inline` from
C++17. This special case does not change the semantics of existing code, but
means that it is now unnecessary to provide a separate definition for the member
in a source file. This applies _only_ to `static constexpr` data members, not to
other `constexpr` variables, and not to data members that are merely `static
const`.
