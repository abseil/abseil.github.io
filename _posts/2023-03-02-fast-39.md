Benchmarks are only a tool for debugging efficiency: Production is ultimately
what matters. Benchmarks analyze the performance of code under the specific
circumstances created and maintained by the benchmark. They cannot perfectly
predict the performance of code in the real world. In this episode, we discuss
some of the pitfalls of microbenchmarks and mitigation strategies.

For example, we can use the following series of benchmarks for evaluating
changes to search query performance:

*   [Posting List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_index) iteration
    benchmarks
*   Single task loadtests
*   Cluster loadtests of many tasks
*   Production

Each benchmark is increasingly more complicated and increasingly more accurate
but takes more time to run. It is not uncommon for the first and last to
disagree. It is less common for single task loadtests to disagree with cluster
loadtests but it happens. The reason to have the hierarchy of benchmarks is to
*optimize the iterative process* of developing performance optimizations
themselves. If we are able to observe and iterate faster (a shorter
"[OODA loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OODA_loop)"), we explore more ideas
more quickly.

There is a parallel here to testing, starting from narrow scope (unit tests) to
increasing scope (integration and system tests) to production itself. Like
correctness testing, performance testing is complicated. Unfortunately,
performance testing is less predictive than correctness testing, especially at
the micro scale. Surrounding code or competing processes might interfere with
network resource, memory bandwidth, CPU instruction decoding, branch predictor,
processor cache utilization, flash i/o, mutexes. If, for example, we have medium
confidence that a passing unittest suggests correctness in prod, then we should
have relatively low confidence in benchmark results materializing the same way
in prod.

## Where benchmarks mislead

There are situations where the results from benchmarks can be misleading when
applied to full applications. The following are some examples of situations
where the results from benchmarks are not applicable at application scale.

### <code>memcmp</code> bloat

Google's software tends to be instruction footprint-heavy, challenging our
ability to effectively cache it, which leads to
[frontend stalls on our processors](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/44271.pdf).
The functions provided by libc are no exception.

In
"[AsmDb: Front-End Stalls in WSC](https://storage.googleapis.com/pub-tools-public-publication-data/pdf/e52f61fd2c51e8962305120548581efacbc06ffc.pdf)"
(Figure 13 / Section 4.4), the glibc implementation for `memcmp` was ~6KB,
leading to icache misses of its own and evictions of other functions. The
implementation for glibc is in hand-written assembly, using a variety of
techniques based on comparison size to obtain "good" performance. 99% of cycles
in the function span 41 cache lines, or about 2.6KB of cache capacity.

Individually, these small micro-optimizations were entirely justifiable with
microbenchmarks. We saw this in greater detail while developing a
[Google workload-tuned `memcpy` implementation](https://research.google/pubs/pub50338/):
"Faster" implementations on microbenchmarks had larger code footprints and
produced *worse* macrobenchmark results than seemingly slower implementations
that had smaller code footprints.

This is undoubtedly a place where hardware acceleration can shine to deliver its
best possible performance consistently, rather than having programmers optimize
their implementations for each generation (only to make things worse in real
workloads).

### Arithmetic versus load

Consider a simple masking function, to get the lower bits of a value:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-cpp code">
uint32_t getLowerBits(uint32_t value, int bits) {
  return value & ((uint64_t{1} &lt;&lt; bits) - 1);
}
</pre>

This requires several instructions and processor uops to shift, subtract, and
finally mask. This might motivate loading a precomputed array of masks.

<pre class="prettyprint lang-cpp code">
constexpr uint32_t kMasks[] = {0x1, 0x3, 0x7, 0xf, ...};

uint32_t getLowerBits(uint32_t value, int bits) {
  return value & kMasks[bits];
}
</pre>

This might appear to be a profitable optimization in microbenchmarks. `kMasks`
can be consistently cached in L1. Modeling cache behavior in microbenchmarks is
challenging: Microbenchmarks tend to have small working sets that tend to be
cache resident. Real code, particularly Google C++, is not.

In production, the cacheline holding `kMasks` might be evicted, leading to much
worse stalls (hundreds of cycles to access main memory). Additionally, on x86
processors since Haswell, this [optimization can be past its prime](/fast/9):
BMI2's `bzhi` instruction is both faster than loading and masking *and* delivers
more consistent performance.

When developing benchmarks for
[SwissMap](https://abseil.io/blog/20180927-swisstables), individual operations
were benchmarked in two ways: always triggering a cache hit and always
triggering a cache miss. The latter can be achieved by having enough hashtables
that their working set will not fit in cache, then picking a hashtable to lookup
at random on every iteration of the benchmark.

Having explicit benchmarks for the boundary conditions - always-cache-hit and
always-cache-miss gives more insight on how changes to the code affect its
operations under different conditions and help develop intuition on which
operations are important to optimize to reach our goal: improve production
performance.

### TCMalloc's suspicious prefetch

TCMalloc has a suspicious prefetch on its allocation path. By the time we've
computed which object to return, prefetching would be too late: User code could
begin using the object within a few cycles. Instead, it prefetches the *next*
object of the same size class that would be returned. This object will not be
used by the application until the next time we allocate another object of the
same size.

This prefetch appears to be extraordinarily costly: Microbenchmarks measuring
allocation performance show potential savings if it were removed and Google-Wide
Profiling shows 70%+ of cycles in `new`'s fastpath on the prefetch. Removing it
would "reduce" the
[data center tax](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/44271.pdf),
but we would actually hurt [application productivity](/fast/7)-per-CPU. Time we
spend in malloc is
[less important than application performance](https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-research2023-media/pubtools/6170.pdf).

Trace-driven simulations with hardware-validated architectural simulators showed
the prefetched data was frequently used. Additionally, it is better to stall on
a TLB miss at the prefetch site--which has no dependencies, than to stall at the
point of use.

## Pitfalls {#pitfalls}

There are a number of things that commonly go wrong when writing benchmarks. The
following is a non-exhaustive list:

*   Data being resident. Workloads have large footprints, a small footprint may
    be instruction bound, whereas the true workload could be
    [memory bound](/fast/62). There's a trade-off between adding instructions to
    save some memory costs vs placing data in memory to save instructions.
*   Small instruction cache footprint. Google codes typically have large
    instruction footprints. Benchmarks are often cache resident. The `memcmp`
    and TCMalloc examples go directly to this.
*   Sensitivity to function and branch alignment. Small changes to code layout
    and branch alignment can have large effects on microbenchmark performance.
    Code being changed can also affect neighboring code that is actually
    benchmarked, leading to paradoxical speedups and slowdowns. For example,
    `memcpy` has 20% swings from this effect. For several years,
    [snappy](https://github.com/google/snappy) had "load bearing nops" to
    perturb branch alignment of an inner loop to an optimal state.
    [Stabilizer (by Berger, et. al.)](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~emery/pubs/stabilizer-asplos13.pdf)
    deliberately perturb these parameters to improve benchmarking statistical
    quality.
*   Sensitivity to stack alignment. Changes anywhere in the stack--added/removed
    variables, better (or worse) spilling due to compiler optimizations,
    etc.--can affect the alignment at the start of the function-under-test. This
    has been seen to produce 20% performance swings.
*   Representative data. The data in the benchmark needs to be "similar" to the
    data in production - for example, imagine having short strings in the
    benchmark, and long strings in the fleet. This also extends to the code
    paths in the benchmarks being similar to the code paths that the application
    exercises. This is a common pain point for macrobenchmarks too. A loadtest
    may cover certain request types, rather than all of those seen by production
    servers.

*   Benchmarking the right code. It's very easy to introduce code into the
    benchmark that's not present in the real workload. For example, using a
    random number generator's cost for a benchmark could exceed the cost of the
    work being benchmarked.

*   Being aware of steady state vs dynamic behaviour. For more complex
    benchmarks it's easy to produce something that converges to a steady state -
    for example if it has a constant arrival rate and service time. Production
    workloads may demonstrate more variability.

## Leveraging benchmarks fully

Focus on [writing microbenchmarks](/fast/75) that test individual properties of
the component under test. Using Search as an example, consider the compute
kernel of search intersects posting lists (PLs). A posting list is a sorted
sequence of hits, where a hit is an occurrence of a term in a document. When a
query like "dog AND cat" is executed, the PLs for terms "dog" and "cat" are
intersected to find the documents that contain both "dog" and "cat".

For PLs we benchmark the basic operations of a PL:

*   PL iterator creation/destruction
*   PL iterator iteration
*   PL iterator advance (jump forward)

Observe production behaviour to determine the appropriate code and functionality
to optimize:

*   Profile production jobs to identify which operation is critical to
    performance.

    In some cases, PL iterator advance is where the majority of CPU cycles are
    spent. In others, PL iterator creation is as critical as PL iterator
    advance.

*   After identification of the above, one can start looking for opportunities
    to:

    *   improve PL iterator creation/destruction **without** pessimizing PL
        iterator advance
    *   improve PL iterator advance **without** pessimizing PL iterator
        creation/destruction

    Note: PL iterator iteration is largely irrelevant - at this particular time
    and shape of the system

After coming up with a strategy and prototype to improve the two microbenchmarks
in isolation, run a more accurate test (single task) to validate that this
results in meaningful improvements. The next steps depend on whether this, more
accurate, benchmark also produces favorable results:

*   If not, it is very important to understand why and fix the microbenchmark:
    it is likely not measuring what is intended!
*   If yes, then proceed with higher accuracy tests (full cluster/prod) and
    gather artifacts measuring the impact of the change.

One might wonder why writing the PL iterator iteration benchmark is useful if it
does not show up in production profiles. One useful piece of information we can
extract from this benchmark is the relative performance of iteration vs advance.
With such knowledge at hand, one can look into opportunities to use iteration
more prominently in the intersection kernel code. For example, it may be more
efficient to replace the advance operation with multiple iteration actions.
Pragmatically, even though iteration contributes few cycles, we don't want its
performance to regress to the point where it does take significant time.

## Summary

Benchmarks are a useful way to prototype the impact of code changes on
production systems. However, writing benchmarks that accurately reflect
production performance is hard. There are multiple pitfalls where the size of
the benchmark, or other of its characteristics, may lead to incorrect estimates
of production impact. One approach to solving this is to have multiple
benchmarks, with increasing fidelity and complexity. Understanding why a
particular benchmark does not produce representative results is a critical step
in improving benchmark fidelity, and can even produce insights into production
behavior.
