“Explicit is better than implicit.” --
[PEP 20](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/)

## TL;DR:

Most constructors should be `explicit`.

## Introduction

Prior to C++11, the `explicit` keyword was meaningful only for constructors that
could be called with a single argument, and our style guide required its use for
such constructors so that they did not act as “converting constructors”. That
requirement was not applied for multi-parameter constructors. Indeed the style
guide used to discourage use of `explicit` for multi-parameter constructors as
it had no meaning. That’s no longer the case.

In C++11, `explicit` became meaningful for copy-initialization from braced
lists, such as when calling a function `void f(std::pair<int, int>)` with `f({1,
2})` or when initializing a variable `bad` with `std::vector<char> bad =
{"hello", "world"};`.

Wait a minute! In that last example the types don’t match. That can’t compile,
can it? `std::vector<std::string> good = {"hello", "world"};` would be
reasonable, but a `std::vector<char>` can’t hold two `std::string`s. And yet it
does compile (or at least it does with all current C++ compilers). What’s up
with that? Let’s come back to that later, after we’ve talked more about
`explicit`.

## Constructors That Change Types, But Not Values

Constructors that aren’t marked as `explicit` can be invoked by the compiler to
create a value without mentioning the type's name. That’s great when we have the
value we want already but the types just don’t quite match -- we have a `const
char[]` and we need a `std::string`, maybe, or we have two `std::string`s and we
want a `std::vector<std::string>`, or we have an `int` and we want a `BigNum`.
In short, it works well if the value is essentially the same before and after
the conversion.

<pre class="prettyprint lang-cpp code">
// The coordinates of a point in the Cartesian plane, w.r.t. some basis.
class Coordinate2D {
 public:
  Coordinate2D(double x, double y);
  // ...
};

// Computes the Euclidean norm of a given point `p`.
double EuclideanNorm(Coordinate2D p);

// Uses of the non-explicit constructor:
double norm = EuclideanNorm({3.0, 4.0});  // passing a function argument
Coordinate2D origin = {0.0, 0.0};         // initializing with `=`
Coordinate2D Translate(Coordinate2D p, Vector2D v) {
  return {p.x() + v.x(), p.y() + v.y()};  // returning a value from a function
}
</pre>

By declaring the constructor `Coordinate2D(double, double)` without `explicit`
we allow for passing `{3.0, 4.0}` to a function that takes a `Coordinate2D`
parameter. Given that `{3.0, 4.0}` is a perfectly reasonable value for such an
object, no confusion arises from this affordance.

## Constructors That Do More

Implicitly calling a constructor isn’t such a good idea if its output is a
different value than its input, or if it might have preconditions.

Consider a `Request` class with a constructor `Request(Server*, Connection*)`.
There’s no sense in which the value of the request object “is” the server and
connection — it’s just that we can create a request that uses them. There could
be many semantically different types that can be constructed from `{server,
connection}`, such as a `Response`. Such a constructor should be `explicit`, so
that we can’t pass `{server, connection}` to a function that accepts a `Request`
(or `Response`) parameter. In such cases marking the constructor as `explicit`
makes the code clearer for readers by requiring the target type to be named when
it’s instantiated and helps to avoid bugs caused by unintended conversions.

<pre class="prettyprint lang-cpp code">
// A line is defined by two distinct points.
class Line {
 public:
  // Constructs the line passing through the given points.
  // REQUIRES: p1 != p2
  explicit Line(Coordinate2D p1, Coordinate2D p2);

  // Determines whether this line contain a given point `p`.
  bool ContainsPoint(Coordinate2D p) const;
};

Line line({0, 0}, {42, 1729});

// Computes the gradient of `line`.  Returns an infinite value if `line` is
// vertical.
double Gradient(const Line& line);
</pre>

By declaring the constructor `Line(Coordinate2D, Coordinate2D)` as `explicit`,
we prevent code from passing unrelated points to Gradient without first
deliberately turning them into a `Line` object. The "value" of a `Line` isn't
the two points, and not any two points define a `Line`.

As another example, the use of `explicit` for ownership transfer from a raw
pointer in `std::unique_ptr` prevents a double-`delete` bug here:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-cpp bad-code">
std::vector&lt;std::unique_ptr&lt;int&gt;&gt; v;
int* p = new int(-1);
v.push_back(p);  // error: cannot convert int* to std::unique_ptr&lt;int&gt;
// ...
v.push_back(p);
</pre>

To pass a `std::unique_ptr` the programmer must explicitly create one, which
leaves a visual clue for readers that ownership is being transferred. The
`explicit` constructor helps to document the constraint that the raw pointer
must own its target.

## Recommendations

*   Copy constructors and move constructors should never be `explicit`.
*   Make a constructor `explicit` unless its arguments "are" the value of the
    newly created object. (Note:
    [the Google style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Implicit_Conversions)
    currently requires all single-argument constructors to be `explicit`).
*   In particular, constructors for types where identity (address) is relevant
    to the value should be `explicit`.
*   Constructors that impose additional constraints on values (i.e., that have
    preconditions) should be `explicit`. Sometimes those are better implemented
    as factory functions (see
    [Tip #42: Prefer Factory Functions to Initializer Methods](/tips/42)).

## Closing Remarks

This tip can be viewed as the flip-side of
[Tip #88: Initialization: =, (), and {}](/tips/88#best-practices-for-initialization),
which advises us to use copy-initialization syntax (with `=`) when initializing
from “the intended literal value”. The advice of the present tip is to omit
`explicit` only when tip 88 says to use copy initialization (which would
otherwise be disallowed by the `explicit` keyword).

Finally, a word of warning: The C++ Standard Library doesn’t always get this
right. Going back to our example (that mistakenly declared a `std::vector<char>`
rather than a container of strings):

<pre class="prettyprint lang-cpp bad-code">
std::vector&lt;char&gt; bad = {"hello", "world"};
</pre>

we find that `std::vector` has a templated “range” constructor taking a pair of
iterators, which matches here and deduces the parameter types as `const char*`.
If the recommendations in this tip were applied, that constructor would be
`explicit`, because the value of a `std::vector<char>` is not two iterators
(rather, it’s a sequence of characters). As it is, `explicit` was omitted, and
this example code gives undefined behavior as the second iterator is not
reachable from the first.
