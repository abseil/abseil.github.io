## A new syntax

C++17
[allows](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2016/p0305r1.html)
`if` and `switch` statements to include an initializer:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-cpp code">
if (init; cond) { /* ... */ }
switch (init; cond) { /* ... */ }
</pre>

This syntax lets you keep the scope of variables as tight as possible:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-cpp code">
if (auto it = m.find("key"); it != m.end()) {
  return it-&gt;second;
} else {
  return absl::NotFoundError("Entry not found");
}
</pre>

The semantics of the initializer are exactly as in the `for` statement; details
below.

## When this is useful

One of the most important ways to manage complexity is to break complex systems
down into non-interacting, local parts that can be understood in isolation and
ignored in their entirety. In C++, the presence of variables increases
complexity, and *scopes* allow us to limit the extent of this complexity: the
less a variable is in scope, the less often a reader needs to remember that the
variable exists.

When demanding reader attention, it is thus valuable to limit the scopes of
variables to where they are actually needed. The new syntax offers one new tool
for this. Contrast then this new syntax with the alternative code one would have
written prior to C++17: Either we keep the scopes tight, and thus need to write
additional braces:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-cpp code">
{
  auto it = m.find("key");
  if (it != m.end()) {
    return it-&gt;second;
  } else {
    return absl::NotFoundError("Entry not found");
  }
}
</pre>

Or, as seems to be the more typical solution, we do *not* keep the scopes tight
and just &ldquo;leak&rdquo; the variables:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-cpp code">
auto it = m.find("key");
if (it != m.end()) {
  return it-&gt;second;
} else {
  return absl::NotFoundError("Entry not found");
}
</pre>

By contrast, the new style is self-contained: It is not possible to move the
`if` statement without also moving the variable and its scope. The local meaning
of the variable remains unchanged as code is moved around or copy-pasted. With
the previous styles, code movement could accidentally change the scope of the
variable (if the outer braces are not copied), or its meaning (if the variable
itself is not copied and a variable with that name is in scope), or introduce a
name clash.

The complexity considerations lead to the common adage that variable name length
should match the variable scope&rsquo;s size; that is, variables that are in
scope for longer should have longer names (since they need to make sense to a
reader that has long moved on). Conversely, smaller scopes permit shorter names.
When variable names are leaked (as above), we see regrettable patterns emerge
such as: multiple variables `it1`, `it2`, ... become necessary to avoid clashes;
variables are reassigned (`auto it = m1.find(/* ... */); it = m2.find(/* ...
*/)`; or variables get intrusively long names (`auto database_index_iter =
m.find(/* ... */)`).

## Details, scopes, declarative regions

The new, optional initializer in `if` and `switch` statements works exactly like
the initializer in a `for` statement. (The latter is essentially a `while`
statement with initializer.) That is, the syntax-with-initializer is mostly just
syntactic sugar around the following rewrites:

Sugared form                  | Rewritten as
----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------
`if (init; cond) BODY`        | `{ init; if (cond) BODY }`
`switch (init; cond) BODY`    | `{ init; switch (cond) BODY }`
`for (init; cond; incr) BODY` | `{ init; while (cond) { BODY; incr; } }`

Importantly, the names declared in the initializer are in scope of a potential
`else` arm of an `if` statement.

There is one difference, though: In the sugared form, the initializer is in the
same scope as the condition and body (of both the `if` and the `else` arm),
rather than in a separate, larger scope. This means that variable names must be
unique across all these parts, though they may shadow earlier declarations. The
following examples illustrate the various disallowed redeclarations and allowed
shadowing declarations:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-cpp code">
int w;

if (int x, y, z; int y = g()) {   // error: y redeclared, first declared in initializer
  int x;                          // error: x redeclared, first declared in initializer
  int w;                          // OK, shadows outer variable
  {
    int x, y;                     // OK, shadowing in nested scope is allowed
  }
} else {
  int z;                          // error: z redeclared, first declared in initializer
}

if (int w; int q = g()) {         // declaration of "w" OK, shadows outer variable
  int q;                          // error: q redeclared, first declared in condition
  int w;                          // error: w redeclared, first declared in initializer
}
</pre>

## Interaction with structured bindings

C++17 also introduces *structured bindings*, a mechanism to assign names to the
elements of a &ldquo;destructurable&rdquo; value (such as a tuple, an array, or
a simple struct): `auto [iter, ins] = m.insert(/* ... */);`

That feature plays nicely with the new initializer in the `if` statement:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-cpp code">
if (auto [iter, ins] = m.try_emplace(key, data); ins) {
  use(iter-&gt;second);
} else {
  LOG(ERROR) &lt;&lt; "Key '" &lt;&lt; key &lt;&lt; "' already exists.";
}
</pre>

Another example comes from using C++17&rsquo;s new *node handles* that allow
true moving of elements between maps or sets without copying. This feature
defines an *insert-return-type* that is destructurable and that results from
inserting a node handle:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-cpp code">
if (auto [iter, ins, node] = m2.insert(m1.extract(k)); ins) {
  LOG(INFO) &lt;&lt; "Element with key '" &lt;&lt; k &lt;&lt; "' transferred successfully";
} else if (!node) {
  LOG(ERROR) &lt;&lt; "Key '" &lt;&lt; k &lt;&lt; "' does not exist in first map.";
} else {
  LOG(ERROR) &lt;&lt; "Key '" &lt;&lt; k &lt;&lt; "' already in m2; m2 unchanged; m1 changed.";
}
</pre>

## Conclusion

Use the new `if (init; cond)` and `switch (init; cond)` syntax when you need a
new variable for use within the `if` or `switch` statement that is not needed
outside of it. This simplifies the ambient code. Moreover, since the
variable&rsquo;s scope is now small, its name can be shorter, too.
