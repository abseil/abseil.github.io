## Two Kinds of Null Pointer Checks

Checking a pointer for null before dereferencing is important to avoid crashes
and bugs. This can be done in two ways:

```c++
if (foo) {
  DoSomething(*foo);
}
```

```c++
if (foo != nullptr) {
  DoSomething(*foo);
}
```

Both of these conditionals have the same semantics given that `foo` is a
pointer, but the type-checking on the latter is a little tighter. Many types
in C++ can be implicitly converted to `bool`, and additional caution
is required when the pointed-to type can itself be converted to `bool`.

Consider the following code which could have two very different meanings:

```c++
// Bad code
bool* is_migrated = ...;

// Is this checking that `is_migrated` is not null, or was the actual
// intent to verify that `*is_migrated` is true?
if (is_migrated) {
  ...
}
```

This code is clearer:

```c++
// Good code
// Looks like a null-pointer check for a bool*
if (is_migrated != nullptr) {
  ...
}
```

Both styles are acceptable in Google C++ code. So when the underlying type is
not implicitly convertible to `bool`, follow the style of surrounding code. If
the value in question is a "smart pointer" like `std::unique_ptr`, the semantics
and tradeoffs are the same.

## Optional Values and Scoped Assignments

What about (e.g. `absl::optional`) values? They deserve more careful
consideration.

For example:

```c++
// Bad code
absl::optional<bool> b = MaybeBool();
if (b) { ... }  // What happens when the function returns absl::optional(false)?
```

... is less clear than the following code:

```c++
// Better code
absl::optional<bool> b = MaybeBool();
if (b.has_value()) { ... }
```

Note, however, that the code snippets above are actually equivalent:
`absl::optional`'s conversion to `bool` only looks at whether the `optional` is
full, not at its contents. A reader may find it counter-intuitive that
`optional(false)` is `true`, but it's immediately clear that `optional(false)`
has a value. Again, it's worth extra caution when the underlying type is
implicitly convertible to `bool`.

One pattern for optional return-values is to put a variable declaration in the
conditional of the `if`. This
[limits the scope](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Local_Variables)
of the variable, but involves an implicit conversion to `bool`:

```c++
if (absl::optional<Foo> foo = MaybeFoo()) {
  DoSomething(*foo);
}
```

However, avoid this pattern if the underlying type is implicitly convertible to
`bool`.

## "Boolean-like" Enums

Let's say you've taken the advice of [TotW #94](/tips/94) and decided to use an
`enum` in your function signature instead of a `bool` for better readability at
the call sites. This kind of refactoring might introduce an implicit conversion
in the function definition:

```c++
// Bad code
void InitGoogle(
    const char* usage, int* argc, char*** argv,
    StripFlagsMode strip_flags_mode) {
  if (strip_flags_mode) {  // Wait, which value was true again?
    ...
  }
}
```

You can gain additional clarity by replacing the implicit conversion with an
explicit comparison:

```c++
// Good code
void InitGoogle(
    const char* usage, int* argc, char*** argv,
    StripFlagsMode strip_flags_mode) {
  if (strip_flags_mode == kPreserveGoogleFlags) {
    ...
  }
}
```

## Summary

In summary, be aware that implicit conversions to `bool` can be unclear, so
consider writing more explicit code:

*   Compare pointer types to `nullptr` (especially if the pointed-at type is
    implicitly convertible to `bool`).
*   Test container emptiness with boolean functions like
    `absl::optional<T>::has_value()` (especially if the contained type is
    implcitly convertible to `bool`).
*   Compare enums to specific values.
