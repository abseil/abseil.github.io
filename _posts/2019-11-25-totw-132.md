Associative containers in all their various incarnations are one of the most
common abstractions in C++. There are several common patterns that lead us to do
needless work. Here are some tricks to avoid the extra costs.

## Accumulating Results

Sometimes maps are used to gather common keys and aggregate information. For
example:

```c++
// BAD CODE: key string is copied in both maps
absl::flat_hash_map<std::string, int> word_counts;
absl::flat_hash_map<std::string, std::vector<std::string>> word_origins;
for (const auto& [origin, words] : origin_to_words) {
  for (const std::string& w : words) {
    if (!word_counts.contains(w)) {      // 1st lookup
      InsertOrDie(&word_counts, w, 0);   // 2nd lookup; 1st extra string copy
    }
    ++word_counts[w];                    // 3rd lookup

    if (!word_origins.contains(w)) {     // 4th lookup
      InsertOrDie(&word_origins, w, {}); // 5th lookup; 2nd extra string copy
    }
    word_origins[w].push_back(origin);   // 6th lookup
  }
}
```

This pattern is fairly common when people forget that `operator[]` will insert a
[value-initialized](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/value_initialization)
instance of `V` if the key is not already present. Thus we can write just:

```c++
// key string is copied in both maps
absl::flat_hash_map<std::string, int> word_counts;
absl::flat_hash_map<std::string, std::vector<std::string>> word_origins;
for (const auto& [origin, words] : origin_to_words) {
  const std::vector<std::string>& words = p.second;
  for (const std::string& w : words) {
    ++word_counts[w];                    // 1st lookup
    word_origins[w].push_back(origin);   // 2nd lookup
  }
}
```

Better yet, combine the maps into a single struct to avoid duplicate lookups and
double storage of keys.

```
struct WordInfo {
  int count = 0;
  std::vector<std::string> origins;
};

absl::flat_hash_map<std::string, WordInfo> words_to_info;
for (const auto& [origin, words] : origin_to_words) {
  for (const std::string& w : words) {
    auto& info = words_to_info[w];
    ++info.count;
    info.origins.push_back(origin);
  }
}
```

This pattern works whenever a default value matches the base case for our
accumulation. It also reads very cleanly.

## One-Time Initialization

Other times, maps cache heavy computations or complicated objects.

```
// BAD CODE
class CobblerCache {
 public:
  const CobblerInterface& GetCobbler(const std::string& key) {
    if (!cobblers_.contains(key)) {                          // 1st lookup
      InsertOrDie(&cobblers_, key, FluevogMaker::Create());  // 2nd lookup
    }
    return *FindOrDie(cobblers_, key);                       // 3rd lookup
  }

 private:
  absl::flat_hash_map<std::string, std::unique_ptr<CobblerInterface>> cobblers_;
};
```

Here we can use the fact that `std::unique_ptr` default-constructs to null to
detect when `operator[]` inserts a new value.

```
class CobblerCache {
 public:
  const CobblerInterface& GetCobbler(const std::string& key) {
    auto& cobbler = cobblers_[key];
    if (cobbler == nullptr) {
      cobbler = FluevogMaker::Create();
    }
    return *cobbler;
  }

 private:
  absl::flat_hash_map<std::string, std::unique_ptr<CobblerInterface>> cobblers_;
};
```

Note that `cobbler` is a reference to the value in the map, allowing us to set
the value after the `operator[]` call without any extra work. This pattern works
whenever the default value of `mapped_type()` is also a sentinel of some kind.

## Safe Lookup

Sometimes you just want to find something in a map or bail out safely.

```
// BAD CODE
class CobblerCache {
 public:
  std::unique_ptr<Shoe> MaybeMakeShoe(const std::string& key,
                                      const ShoeSpec& spec) {
    if (!cobblers_.contains(key)) return nullptr;      // 1st lookup
    return FindOrDie(cobblers_, key)->MakeShoe(spec);  // 2nd lookup
  }

 private:
  absl::flat_hash_map<std::string, std::unique_ptr<CobblerInterface>> cobblers_;
};
```

Instead, consider writing something like the following.

```
class CobblerCache {
 public:
  std::unique_ptr<Shoe> MaybeMakeShoe(const std::string& key,
                                      const ShoeSpec& spec) {
    auto it = cobblers_.find(key);
    if (it == cobblers_.end()) return nullptr;
    return it->second->MakeShoe(spec);
  }
```

## Counting Collisions

Sometimes you want to insert when it was not found and react accordingly.

```
// BAD CODE
int duplicates = 0;
absl::flat_hash_set<std::string> seen;

for (const std::string& id : ids) {
  if (seen.contains(id)) {  // 1st lookup
    ++duplicates;
  } else {
    seen.insert(id);        // 2nd lookup
  }
}
```

Once again, the native API provides an alternative.

Tip: Recall that
[`absl::flat_hash_set::insert`](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/unordered_set/insert)
(like [`map::insert`](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/map/insert))
returns a pair: an iterator to the inserted element (or to the existing element)
and a bool indicating whether the insertion occurred.

```
int duplicates = 0;
absl::flat_hash_set<std::string> seen;

for (const std::string& id : ids) {
  if (!seen.insert(id).second) {
    ++duplicates;
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

It is often possible to use associative containers efficiently without
sacrificing readability. Learn and use the APIs that allow you to do so.
Container types are used so pervasively that it is okay to assume your reader is
familiar with these techniques.
