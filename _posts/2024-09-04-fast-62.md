To accomplish useful work with processors, programs need to access main memory.
The rate that programs can transfer data to/from main memory has not grown as
fast as processors getting greater per-core performance and more cores. The
Memory Wall, [long predicted](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/216585.216588), is
here. Memory bandwidth is increasingly the bottleneck for how much useful work
modern data centers can accomplish with its CPUs. Optimizing for memory
bandwidth productivity can make code faster--by reducing memory stalls--and RAM
footprints smaller. In this episode, we discuss techniques for identifying
hotspots and reducing their impact.

## Memory bandwidth basics

Reads and writes while a program is running trigger accesses to memory.
Accessing RAM is slow--approximately
[100 nanoseconds](https://sre.google/static/pdf/rule-of-thumb-latency-numbers-letter.pdf)--so
processors have added layers of caches in between the execution units and the
physical modules of RAM. On x86, this started with a single kilobyte-sized cache
on the 386, but modern processors have several layers of caches (L1/L2/L3). The
closer to the processor, the smaller but faster the caches typically are.

The processor's caches work at a granularity of a *cache line*, typically a
64-byte chunk of data. This simplifies the hardware--which can track whether a
cache line is *dirty* and needs to be written to main memory at the cache line
level--rather than say tracking byte-by-byte. This abstraction is also useful in
practice--common primitive data types like `int` and `T*` all span several
bytes. Accessing the cache line from main memory is an all-or-nothing affair:
Loading any one byte means the whole line is read from memory.

In addition to a program's loads and stores, the processor can issue prefetches
for data at the hardware level. These prefetches need to be timely, the data
needs to be ready before the program actually needs it, but not so early that it
is evicted from the cache before it can be used. Prefetches also need to be
useful: Pulling in a cache line that ends up being unaccessed consumes memory
bandwidth without the benefit of avoiding a cache miss on the critical path.

The processor's memory bus can handle thousands of transfers per second, limited
by technology, power requirements, and physics. While cache sizes and the memory
bus differ across different architectures, the same general principles apply. At
the socket level, this can give the processor several GB/second of *memory
bandwidth*. These windows to transfer data are akin to seats on an airplane,
though: If the airline oversells a flight and everyone shows up at the airport,
several passengers will be forced to wait for the next flight (in the case of
CPUs there aren't any refunds). Bursts in memory accesses, especially across
many cores, can saturate our memory bus, even if the average over time is
relatively low. Similarly, once a plane takes off, any unsold seats are wasted
and cannot aid future bursts.

This perspective suggests two paths to reducing how much data needs to move to
and from main memory: 1) access fewer things; 2) increase the reuse of the data
the program accesses.

Making a program's working set more cacheable allows it to be less bottlenecked
on memory bandwidth and fewer cache misses reduce memory latency, allowing the
program to speed up.

## Finding bottlenecks

We can use data collected with the `perf` tool on a locally executed process.

While LLC misses are only an approximation--this event only tracks misses on
loads--it can be quite effective for finding and fixing bottlenecks. Hardware
performance counter limitations largely restrict to load events while
simultaneously having precise attribution. Attribution to functions is what
allows us to find source code-level optimizations. A cache miss on a load is
*most likely* a read transaction on the memory bus and also *probably*
corresponds to a previous cache eviction at some earlier point in time. The
absolute numbers of misses are less important for finding places to look for
optimizations than their *relative* rankings.

## How to measure

A key part of optimization work is measuring the outcomes. While
[production is ultimately what matters](/fast/39), smaller scale proxies such as
microbenchmarks can help with exploring the solution space.

One challenge for optimizing for cache misses with a microbenchmark is that the
working set may be too small and its data will fit neatly into the processor's
caches. One strategy used for
[Abseil's Hashtables](https://abseil.io/about/design/swisstables) is to have
"hot" and "cold" microbenchmarks. The "hot" versions stress a single instance,
whose data footprint fits into the processor's L1 cache. The "cold" versions
work with many instances, ensuring the working set does not fit into the cache.
On modern machines, the cache hierarchy can be several hundred MBs. While an
individual service on a multitenant machine may have to contend with neighbors
also using cache space, a microbenchmark run on an otherwise idle machine can
use the processors caches more completely. While
[neither of these extremes exactly represents production](/fast/75), they show
the contrasts of the computational cost (arithmetic) and memory access costs
required for hashtable operations.

`perf stat -d path/to/benchmark` can provide a quick summary of important
performance counters, including cache misses.

```

The benchmark's large working set made its workload harder to fit into cache,
leading to corresponding increases in L1 and LLC misses. Due to the presence of
cache misses, the same operation--looking up an absent key from a
hashtable--went from ~1.36 nanoseconds to ~22.5 nanoseconds. Worse cache
locality doesn't just consume more memory bandwidth, it also hampers the
performance and CPU efficiency of programs.

Additionally, Google's C++ microbenchmark tool
(https://github.com/google/benchmark/blob/main/docs/user_guide.md) supports
[collecting hardware performance counters](/fast/53). This can be helpful for
isolating the counters to when the benchmark is actually running and to
individual benchmark operations. In contrast, `perf stat` captures the benchmark
harness' own setup and its numbers cover the entirety of all microbenchmark
cases being run.

## Optimization strategies

Our goal is to maximize the productivity of our accesses to cache lines, making
sure our programs accomplish as much useful work as possible for each memory
access. This is not just useful for reducing memory bandwidth needs, but it can
improve CPU and RAM productivity as well. Accessing more data and cachelines
than we need is a source of false demand that we can optimize.

### Avoid unnecessary indirections

Consider a simple linked list containing integers:

```
struct Node { Node* next; int value; }
```

In memory, this will fill part of a cache line (16 bytes out of 64) and each
node is likely to fall on its own cache line, separate from other nodes. Over
time, a program's memory allocations will trend towards being random due to the
mix of allocations and deletions that have left gaps.

This is inefficient to access in several ways:

*   The `next` pointers, while important to the linked list, aren't holding
    *useful* data.
*   Accessing a cache line pulls in only a single 4-byte integer at a time. If
    the program were to use a contiguous data structure like `std::vector`,
    accessing the first element means it likely *also* accessed the cache line
    for the second and so on.
*   Due to alignment requirements, each node has 4 bytes of padding going
    unused.

While `std::list` is quite rare, many containers have similar *implicit*
linked-list like layouts. Matt Kulukundis discussed this in his
[2017 CppCon presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncHmEUmJZf4) on
Abseil's hashtables: Containers like `std::unordered_map` and to a lesser
extent, `absl::node_hash_map` achieve pointer stability by separately allocating
each key-value pair. This guarantee comes at a cost, since the data structure
requires an extra memory access to get to the logical value the program is
accessing.

Similarly, one common pattern is `std::vector<std::unique_ptr<T>>` where there
is an indirection that makes logically adjacent objects not colocated in memory.
It is important to look with a critical eye at whether this indirection is
necessary. Sometimes it exists because T is not copyable/movable. In that case
it may be possible to remove the indirection by fixing the type semantics or by
using a container type that allows non-movable content like `absl::FixedArray`
or `std::deque`. In other cases the indirection may be used to exercise
polymorphic behavior, and techniques like tag-based dispatch may help. There is
no one size fits all solution for this but practical options do exist.

### Minimize copies

Copies are sometimes needed for API or correctness reasons, but extraneous ones
require the processor to do more work. For example:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-cpp bad-code">
void DoStuff(Protobuf);

void Process(const std::vector&lt;Protobuf&gt;& elements) {
  for (Protobuf element : elements) { // Creates a copy of each element.
    DoStuff(element);
  }
}
</pre>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-cpp code">
void DoStuff(Protobuf);

void Process(const std::vector&lt;Protobuf&gt;& elements) {
  for (const Protobuf& element : elements) { // Avoids a copy.
    DoStuff(element);
  }
}
</pre>

The program is copying each element from the vector and then processing that
copy, when no copy would have sufficed. This increases its working set--it has
all of `elements` *and* `element`--and increases pressure on the processor's
cache, making it more likely that the program will trigger evictions and misses.
In addition to the demands on the memory system, the program is also less
productive in terms of its CPU usage--copying isn't helping us process
faster--and RAM usage--its extraneous copy isn't needed.

While this is just an example--and Clang Tidy can recommend fixes for this one
automatically--copies of much larger data structures such as protobufs can
commonly arise.

<pre class="prettyprint lang-cpp bad-code">
void Populate(MyProto* msg, int n) {
  for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; ++i) {
    MySubmessage s;
    s.set_value(i);
    s.mutable_foo()-&gt;set_bar(i);
    *msg-&gt;add_submessage() = s; // Copies, including complex heap allocated structure.
  }
}
</pre>

Populating data in its final destination can minimize the working set size and
improve efficiency:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-cpp code">
void Populate(MyProto* msg, int n) {
  for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; ++i) {
    MySubmessage& s = *msg-&gt;add_submessage();  // Places s in its destination.
    s.set_value(i);
    s.mutable_foo()-&gt;set_bar(i);
  }
}
</pre>

Similarly, many containers guarantee amortized growth, growing by a
multiplicative factor to achieve this guarantee. With each step in growth, we
allocate another buffer, move elements over, and deallocate the old one. Where
we know the final size, a call to `reserve` can avoid these copies and reduce
our working set size.

### Densify data

As explained above, allocating objects contiguously can be particularly
beneficial for memory bandwidth, especially if the access patterns will require
us to traverse objects in sequence. However, the benefits will exist to the
extent that the traversed objects are sufficiently small and can be packed
neatly into cache lines.

In general, densifying data in a way that goes in accordance with its access
patterns can cause improvements to the memory bandwidth consumption of an
application. This lets us use each cache line we access to its fullest. Also, it
helps as prefetchers tend to bring continuous or easy to predict cache lines
into the cache.

Based on this principle and its implications, consider the following guidelines
when writing an application:

*   Compact data structures as much as possible by reducing padding and
    eliminating fields which are never accessed.
*   When processing large amounts of data, narrower data types can increase data
    density when values have constrained ranges. Integers over a small range
    might fit in `int8_t` or `int16_t`, rather than an `int64_t`. Representing a
    small set of values is best done with a narrow `enum`, rather than a
    `std::string`.
*   If some fields are accessed more frequently than others, consider breaking
    down the objects into two distinct classes (i.e. "hot" and "cold") such that
    arrays of hotter fields/objects are closer in memory.
*   In the extreme of this technique, prefer using
    [Structure-of-Arrays (SoA) than Array-of-Structures (AoS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AoS_and_SoA)
    to define the layout of the data structures in your program.

As a concrete example of SoA vs. AoS, consider the following code snippet (AoS):

<pre class="prettyprint lang-cpp bad-code">
struct Point3D {
  float x;
  float y;
  float z;
};

float AddAllY(const std::vector&lt;Point3D&gt;& elements) {
  float result = 0;
  for (const auto& element : elements) {
    result += element.y;
  }
  return result;
}
</pre>

A more optimal alternative could be the following (SoA):

<pre class="prettyprint lang-cpp code">
struct PointList3D {
  std::vector&lt;float&gt; x;
  std::vector&lt;float&gt; y;
  std::vector&lt;float&gt; z;
};

float AddAllY(const PointList3D& elements) {
  float result = 0;
  for (auto element : elements.y) {  // Traverse the array of "y" coordinates.
    result += element;
  }
  return result;
}
</pre>

## Summary

As with CPU and RAM usage, memory bandwidth is another dimension that we can
optimize for, maximizing [the amount of useful work](/fast/7) we can do with the
minimal amount of memory bandwidth. Reducing cache misses and improving data
locality can also bring improvements to CPU performance and reducing required
RAM footprints.
