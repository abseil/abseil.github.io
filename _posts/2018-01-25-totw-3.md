Users are often surprised when a reviewer says, "Don't use the string
concatenation operator, it's not that efficient." How can it be that
`std::string::operator+` is inefficient? Isn't it hard to get that wrong?

It turns out, such inefficiency isnâ€™t clear cut. These two snippets have
close to the same execution time, in practice:

```cpp
std::string foo = LongString1();
std::string bar = LongString2();
std::string foobar = foo + bar;

std::string foo = LongString1();
std::string bar = LongString2();
std::string foobar = absl::StrCat(foo, bar);
```

However, the same is not true for these two snippets:

```cpp
std::string foo = LongString1();
std::string bar = LongString2();
std::string baz = LongString3();
string foobar = foo + bar + baz;

std::string foo = LongString1();
std::string bar = LongString2();
std::string baz = LongString3();
std::string foobar = absl::StrCat(foo, bar, baz);
```

The reason these two cases differ can be understood when we pick apart what is
happening in the expression `foo + bar + baz`. Since there are no overloads for
three-argument operators in C++, this operation is necessarily going to make two
calls to `string::operator+`. And between those two calls, the operation will
construct (and store) a temporary string. So
`std::string foobar = foo + bar + baz` is really equivalent to:

```cpp
std::string temp = foo + bar;
std::string foobar = std::move(temp) + baz;
```

Specifically, note that the contents of `foo` and `bar` must be copied to a
temporary location before they are placed within `foobar`. (For more on
`std::move`, see
[Tip of the Week #77: Temporaries, moves, and copies](/tips/77).)

C++11 at least allows the second concatenation to happen without creating a new
string object: `std::move(temp) + baz` is equivalent to
`std::move(temp.append(baz))`. However, it's possible that the buffer initially
allocated for the temporary won't be large enough to hold the final string, in
which case a reallocation (and another copy) will be required. As a result, in
the worst case, chains of `n` string concatenations require `O(n)` reallocations.

It is better instead to use `absl::StrCat()`, a nice helper function from
[absl/strings/str_cat.h][str_cat] that calculates the necessary string
length, reserves that size, and concatenates all of the input data into the
output - a well-optimized `O(n)`. Similarly, for cases like:

```cpp
foobar += foo + bar + baz;
```

use `absl::StrAppend()`, which performs similar optimizations:

```cpp
absl::StrAppend(&foobar, foo, bar, baz);
```

As well, `absl::StrCat()` and `absl::StrAppend()` operate on types other than
just string types: you can use `absl::StrCat`/`absl::StrAppend` to convert
`int32_t`, `uint32_t`, `int64_t`, `uint64_t`, `float`, `double`, `const char*`, and
`string_view`, like this:

```cpp
std::string foo = absl::StrCat("The year is ", year);
```
