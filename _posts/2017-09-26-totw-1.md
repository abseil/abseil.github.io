## What's a `string_view`, and Why Should You Care?

When creating a function to take a (constant) string as an argument, you have
four alternatives: two that you already know, and two of which you might
not be aware:

```cpp
void TakesCharStar(const char* s);             // C convention
void TakesString(const string& s);             // Old Standard C++ convention
void TakesStringView(absl::string_view s);     // Abseil C++ convention
void TakesStringView(std::string_view s);      // C++17 C++ convention
```

The first two cases work best when a caller has the string in the format already
provided, but what happens when a conversion is needed (either from `const
char*` to `string` or `string` to `const char*`)?

Callers needing to convert a `string` to a `const char*` need to use the
(efficient but inconvenient) `c_str()` function:

```cpp
void AlreadyHasString(const string& s) {
  TakesCharStar(s.c_str());               // explicit conversion
}
```

Callers needing to convert a `const char*` to a string don’t need to do anything
additional (the good news) but will invoke the creation of a (convenient but
inefficient) temporary string, copying the contents of that string (the bad
news):

```cpp
void AlreadyHasCharStar(const char* s) {
  TakesString(s); // compiler will make a copy
}
```

## What to Do?

Google’s preferred option for accepting such string parameters is through a
`string_view`. This is a "pre-adopted" type from C++17 - in C++17 builds you
should use `std::string_view`, in any code that can't rely on C++17 yet you
should use `absl::string_view`.

An instance of the `string_view` class can be thought of as a "view" into an
existing character buffer. Specifically, a `string_view` consists of only a
pointer and a length, identifying a section of character data that is not owned
by the `string_view` and cannot be modified by the view. Consequently, making a
copy of a `string_view` is a shallow operation: no string data is copied.

`string_view` has implicit conversion constructors from both `const char*` and
`const string&`, and since `string_view` doesn't copy, there is no O(n) memory
penalty for making a hidden copy. In the case where a `const string&` is passed,
the constructor runs in O(1) time. In the case where a `const char*` is passed,
the constructor invokes a `strlen()` automatically (or you can use the
two-parameter `string_view` constructor).

```cpp
void AlreadyHasString(const string& s) {
  TakesStringView(s); // no explicit conversion; convenient!
}

void AlreadyHasCharStar(const char* s) {
  TakesStringView(s); // no copy; efficient!
}
```

Because the `string_view` does not own its data, any strings pointed to by the
`string_view` (just like a `const char*`) must have a known lifespan, and must
outlast the `string_view` itself. This means that using `string_view` for
storage is often questionable: you need some proof that the underlying data will
outlive the `string_view`.

If your API only needs to reference the string data during a single call, and
doesn't need to modify the data, accepting a `string_view` is sufficient. If you
need to reference the data later or need to modify the data, you can explicitly
convert to a C++ string object using `string(my_string_view)`.

Adding `string_view` into an existing codebase is not always the right answer:
changing parameters to pass by `string_view` can be inefficient if those are
then passed to a function requiring a `string` or a NUL-terminated `const
char*`. It is best to adopt `string_view` starting at the utility code and
working upward, or with complete consistency when starting a new project.

## A Few Additional Notes

* Unlike other string types, you should pass `string_view` by value just like
  you would an int or a double because `string_view` is a small value.
* `string_view` is not necessarily NUL-terminated. Thus, it's not safe to
  write:

```cpp
printf("%s\n", sv.data()); // DON’T DO THIS
```

However, the following is fine:

```cpp
printf("%.*s\n", static_cast<int>(sv.size()), sv.data());
```

*  You can output a `string_view` just like you would a string or a
  `const char*`:

```cpp
std::cout << "Took '" << s << "'";
```

* You can convert an existing routine that accepts `const string&` or
  NUL-terminated `const char*` to `string_view` safely in most cases. The only
  danger we have encountered in performing this operation is if the address of
  the function has been taken, this will result in a build break as the
  resulting function-pointer type will be different.
