> `StatusOr<Readability>`: you don't have to choose!

When the time comes to access the value inside an `absl::StatusOr<T>` object, we
should strive to make that access *safe*, *clear*, and *efficient*.

Note: This tip attempts to highlight
[well lit paths](https://moma.corp.google.com/glossary/term/11ngkm2f_v)
providing guidance for typical use-cases. It is not intended to be exhaustive.
If you encounter edge cases, consider the recommendations and reasoning here and
exercise judgement.

## Recommendation

Accessing the value held by a `StatusOr` should be performed via `operator*` or
`operator->`, after a call to `ok()` has verified that the value is present.

<pre class="prettyprint lang-cpp code">
// The same pattern used when handling a unique_ptr...
std::unique_ptr&lt;Foo&gt; foo = TryAllocateFoo();
if (foo != nullptr) {
  foo-&gt;DoBar();  // use the value object
}

// ...or an optional value...
std::optional&lt;Foo&gt; foo = MaybeFindFoo();
if (foo.has_value()) {
  foo-&gt;DoBar();
}

// ...is also ideal for handling a StatusOr.
absl::StatusOr&lt;Foo&gt; foo = TryCreateFoo();
if (foo.ok()) {
  foo-&gt;DoBar();
}
</pre>

You can limit the scope of a `StatusOr` by declaring it in the initializer of
the `if` statement and checking `ok()` in the condition. If using a `StatusOr`
immediately, you generally *should* limit scope in this way (see
[Tip #165](/tips/165)):

<pre class="prettyprint lang-cpp code">
if (absl::StatusOr&lt;Foo&gt; foo = TryCreateFoo(); foo.ok()) {
  foo-&gt;DoBar();
}
</pre>

## Background on <code>StatusOr</code>

The `absl::StatusOr<T>` class is a
[tagged union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagged_union) with
[value semantics](https://isocpp.org/wiki/faq/value-vs-ref-semantics) indicating
exactly one of the following situations:

*   an object of type `T` is available,
*   an `absl::Status` error (`!ok()`) indicating why the value is not present.

You can read more about `absl::Status` and `absl::StatusOr` in
[Tip #76](/tips/76).

## Safety, Clarity, and Efficiency

Treating the `StatusOr` object as one would treat a smart pointer helps code
achieve clarity while remaining safe and efficient. Below, we will consider some
of the other ways you might have seen a `StatusOr` accessed, and why we prefer
the approach using the indirection operators.

### Alternative Value Accessor Safety Issues

What about `absl::StatusOr<T>::value()`?

<pre class="prettyprint lang-cpp bad-code">
absl::StatusOr&lt;Foo&gt; foo = TryCreateFoo();
foo.value().DoBar();  // Behavior depends on the build mode.
</pre>

Here, the behavior depends on the build mode -- in particular, whether the code
was compiled with exceptions enabled.[^1] As such, it is not clear to readers if
an error status will terminate the program.

The `value()` method combines two actions: a test for validity followed by an
access of the value. It should therefore be used *only if* both actions are
intended (and even then, think twice and consider that its behavior depends on
the build mode). If the status is already known to be `OK`, then your ideal
accessor has semantics of simply accessing the value, which is exactly what
`operator*` and `operator->` provide. In addition to making the code more
precisely indicate your intent, the access will be at least as efficient as
`value()`'s contract to test for validity and then access the value.

### Avoiding Multiple Names for the Same Object

Treating `absl::StatusOr` objects as we would a smart pointer or `optional`
value also allows us to avoid the conceptually awkward situation of having two
variables referring to the same value. It also avoids the naming dilemmas and
`auto` overuse which come with this territory.

<pre class="prettyprint lang-cpp bad-code">
// Without digging up the declaration of TryCreateFoo(), a reader will not
// immediately understand the types here (optional? pointer? StatusOr?).
auto maybe_foo = TryCreateFoo();
// ...compounded by the use of implicit bool rather than `.ok()`.
if (!maybe_foo) { /* handle foo not present */ }
// Now two variables (maybe_foo, foo) represent the same value.
Foo& foo = maybe_foo.value();
</pre>

### Avoiding the <code>_or</code> Suffix

Another benefit of using a `StatusOr` variable's intrinsic value type after
checking for validity (rather than creating multiple variables for the same
value) is that we can use the best name for the `StatusOr` without the need (or
temptation!) to add a prefix or suffix.

There is an analogy here to the
[avoidance of the "`_ptr`"](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Windows_Code)
suffix when naming pointer variables.

<pre class="prettyprint lang-cpp bad-code">
// The type already describes that this is a unique_ptr; `foo` would be fine.
std::unique_ptr&lt;Foo&gt; foo_ptr;

absl::StatusOr&lt;Foo&gt; foo_or = MaybeFoo();
if (foo_or.ok()) {
  const Foo& foo = foo_or.value();
  foo.DoBar();
}
</pre>

If there is only one variable (the `StatusOr`, avoiding a second named variable
for the unwrapped value), we can drop the suffix, simply naming the variable
after its underlying value (just as we do with pointers).

<pre class="prettyprint lang-cpp code">
const absl::StatusOr&lt;Foo&gt; foo = MaybeFoo();
if (foo.ok()) {
  MakeUseOf(*foo);
  foo-&gt;DoBar();
}
</pre>

### Moving from the Value of an <code>absl::StatusOr</code>

We might write code to move from the `T` of an `absl::StatusOr<T>`:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-cpp bad-code">
absl::StatusOr&lt;Foo&gt; foo = MaybeFoo();
if (foo.ok()) {
  ConsumeFoo(std::move(*foo));
}
</pre>

It's a little better, though, to move from the `StatusOr` itself, indicating to
readers (both humans and machines) that the entire `StatusOr` object should not
be used after its value has been moved from:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-cpp code">
absl::StatusOr&lt;Foo&gt; foo = MaybeFoo();
if (foo.ok()) {
  ConsumeFoo(*std::move(foo));
}
</pre>

## Solution

Testing the `absl::StatusOr` object for validity (as you would a smart pointer
or `optional`) and accessing it using `operator*` or `operator->` is readable,
efficient, and safe.

It helps you avoid the potential pitfalls of naming ambiguity mentioned above,
and does it all without the use of any macros.

Code that accesses values via `operator*` or `operator->` (whether using a
pointer, a `StatusOr`, an `optional`, or otherwise) must first verify that the
value is present. This validation should be close to where the value is accessed
so that readers can easily verify that it is present and correct.

[^1]: Per the
    [documentation](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/blob/master/absl/status/statusor.h)
    of the `value()` function, if exceptions are enabled, this will throw
    `absl::BadStatusOrAccess` (which may be caught, meaning the program may
    not terminate). If compiled without exceptions, code will crash with
    `LOG(FATAL)`.
