*"Of the many forms of false culture, a premature converse with abstractions is
perhaps the most likely to prove fatal to the growth of &hellip; vigour of
intellect." &mdash; George Boole.*

Suppose you come across code like this:

```c++
int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
  ParseCommandLineFlags(&argc, &argv, false);
}
```

Can you tell what this code does, and in particular what the last argument
means? Now suppose you've come across this function before, and you know that
the last argument has to do with whether command-line flags are left in `argv`
after the call. Can you tell which is true and which is false?

Of course you don't know, because this is hypothetical, but even in real code,
we have better things to do with our brains than memorize the meaning of every
function parameter, and better things to do with our time than go look up the
documentation for every function call we encounter. We have to be able to make
pretty good guesses about what function calls mean, just from looking at the
callsite.

Well-chosen function names are the key to making function calls readable, but
they're often not enough. We usually need the arguments themselves to give us
some clues about what they mean. For example, you might not know what to make of
`absl::string_view s(x, y);` if you'd never seen `string_view` before, but
`absl::string_view s(my_str.data(), my_str.size());` and `absl::string_view
s("foo");` are much clearer. The trouble with `bool` parameters is that the
argument at the callsite is very often a literal `true` or `false`, and that
gives the reader no contextual cues about the meaning of the parameter, as we
saw in the `ParseCommandLineFlags()` example. This problem is compounded if
there's more than one `bool` parameter, because now you have the additional
problem of figuring out which parameter is which.

So how can we fix code like that example? One (bad) possibility is to do
something like this:

```c++ 
int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
  ParseCommandLineFlags(&argc, &argv, false /* preserve flags */);
}
```

The drawbacks of this approach are evident: it's not clear if that comment is
describing the meaning of the parameter or the effect of the argument. In other
words, is it saying that we're preserving the flags, or is it saying that it's
false that we're preserving the flags? Even if the comment manages to make that
clear, there's still a risk that the comment will get out of sync with the code.

A *better* approach is to specify the name of the parameter in the comment:

```c++
int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
  ParseCommandLineFlags(&argc, &argv, /*remove_flags=*/false);
}
```

This is much clearer, and much less likely to fall out of sync with the code.
[Clang-tidy will even
check](https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/checks/misc-argument-comment.html)
that the comment has the correct parameter name. A less ambiguous but longer
variant is to use an explanatory variable:

```c++
int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
  const bool remove_flags = false;
  ParseCommandLineFlags(&argc, &argv, remove_flags);
}
```

However, explanatory variable names are not checked by the compiler, and so they
may be erroneous. This is a particular problem when you have multiple `bool`
parameters, which might be transposed by the caller.

All these approaches also rely on programmers to consistently remember to add
these comments or variables, and to do so correctly (although clang-tidy will
check the correctness of parameter-name comments).

In many cases, the best solution is to avoid using `bool` parameters in the
first place, and use an `enum` instead. For example, `ParseCommandLineFlags()`
could be declared like this:

```c++
enum ShouldRemoveFlags { kDontRemoveFlags, kRemoveFlags };

void ParseCommandLineFlags(int* argc, char*** argv, ShouldRemoveFlags remove_flags);
```

so that the call could look like this:

```c++
int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
  ParseCommandLineFlags(&argc, &argv, kDontRemoveFlags);
}
```

You can also use an `enum class`, as described in [TotW 86](/tips/86), but
in that case you'd want to use a slightly different naming convention, e.g.:

```c++
enum class ShouldRemoveFlags { kNo, kYes };
â€¦
int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
  ParseCommandLineFlags(&argc, &argv, ShouldRemoveFlags::kNo);
}
```

Obviously, this approach has to be implemented when the function is defined; you
can't really opt into it at the callsite (you can fake it, but for little
benefit). So when you're defining a function, particularly if it's going to be
widely used, the onus is on you to think carefully about how the callsites will
look, and in particular to be very skeptical of `bool` parameters.
