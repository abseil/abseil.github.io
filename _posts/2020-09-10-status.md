The Abseil status library is now available on abseil.io. This library is used
within Google for error handling and contains the following two abstractions:

* `absl::Status`
* `absl::StatusOr<T>` 

Within Google, `absl::Status` is the primary mechanism to gracefully handle
errors across API boundaries (and in particular across RPC boundaries). Some of
these errors may be recoverable, but others may not. Most functions which can
produce a recoverable error should be designed to return either an
absl::Status (or the similar `absl::StatusOr<T>`, which holds either an object
of type `T` or an error).

<!--break-->

A Status can either return “OK” (represented by the `enum absl::StatusCode:kOk`)
or one of a number of canonical error codes to indicate certain error conditions: 

```cpp
absl::Status MyFunction(absl::string_view fname, ...) {
  ...
  // encounter error
  if (error condition) {
    // absl::StatusCode::kInvalidArgument
    return absl::InvalidArgumentError("bad mode");
  }
  // else, return OK
  return absl::OkStatus();
}
```

Abseil also provides an `absl::StatusOr<T>` class template to represent a union of an
`absl::Status` object and an object of type `T`. The `absl::StatusOr<T>` will
either contain an object of type `T` (indicating a successful operation), or an
error (of type `absl::Status`) explaining why such a value is not present. This
abstraction is similar to the proposal in C++ for a `std::expected` type.

For more information, consult the [Abseil Status guide][status-guide] and the list
of [canonical error codes][error-codes].
