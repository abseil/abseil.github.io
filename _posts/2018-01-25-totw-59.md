*"Now join your hands, and with your hands your hearts." --Henry VI, William
Shakespeare*

In March, 2013 we announced the new [string joining
API][str_join] in [Tip #36](/tips/36). The response to the new API was quite
positive, and we worked to make the API even better. Topping the list of
feature requests was the ability to join arbitrary lists of possibly
heterogeneous data (I can only assume that Shakespeare was referring to
joining a heterogeneous collection of hands and hearts). We didn't go with
the varargs or variadic template route, but we did add support for joining
`std::tuple` objects, which addresses this need quite nicely. Simply create
a `std::tuple` containing your heterogeneous data, and `absl::StrJoin()`
will accept it just like any other container. Here are a few examples:

```cpp
auto tup = std::make_tuple(123, "abc", 0.456);
std::string s = absl::StrJoin(tup, "-");
s = absl::StrJoin(std::make_tuple(123, "abc", 0.456), "-");

int a = 123;
std::string b = "abc";
double c = 0.456;

// Works, but copies all arguments.
s = absl::StrJoin(std::make_tuple(a, b, c), "-");
// No copies, but only works with lvalues.
s = absl::StrJoin(std::tie(a, b, c), "-");
// No copies, and works with lvalues and rvalues.
s = absl::StrJoin(std::forward_as_tuple(123, MakeFoo(), c), "-");
```

As with joining any container, the elements of the tuple are formatted using an
`absl::AlphaNumFormatter` by default, but you can specify a custom
[join Formatter][join_formatter] if your tuple contains elements that are not
handled by the default formatter. To format a tuple with multiple custom
element types, your custom `Formatter` object may contain multiple overloads
of `operator()`.

For example:

```cpp
struct Foo {};
struct Bar {};

struct MyFormatter {
  void operator()(string* out, const Foo& f) const {
    out->append("Foo");
  }
  void operator()(string* out, const Bar& b) const {
    out->append("Bar");
  }
};

std::string s = absl::StrJoin(std::forward_as_tuple(Foo(), Bar()), "-",
                         MyFormatter());
EXPECT_EQ(s, "Foo-Bar");
```

The goal of the `absl::StrJoin()` API is to join any collection, range, list, or
group of data using an intuitive and consistent syntax. We think joining
`std::tuple` objects fits nicely with this goal and adds more flexibility to the
API.
