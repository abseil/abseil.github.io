We are pleased to announce, at long last, the initial availability of the Abseil
Logging library.  This library provides facilities for writing short text
messages about the status of a program to stderr, disk files, or other sinks
(via an extension API).

The core interface is the `LOG` macro, which has a streaming interface like
`std::ostream`'s:
```cpp
absl::StatusOr<absl::Duration> GetUserAge(absl::string_view user_name) {
  int user_id = GetUserId(user_name);
  if (user_id == -1) {
    LOG(ERROR) << "No user found named " << user_name;
    return absl::NotFoundError(absl::StrCat("No user found named ", user_name));
  }
  return age_map[user_id];
}
```

The library also supports terminating the process via a severity level named
`FATAL`:
```cpp
absl::Duration GetUserAge(absl::string_view user_name) {
  int user_id = GetUser(user_name);
  if (user_id == -1) {
    LOG(FATAL) << "No user named " << user_name << " found";
    // No need for a return statement; this line is unreachable.
  }
  return age_map[user_id];
}
```

The `CHECK` macro family provides `assert()`-like precondition checking and
process termination **in all compilation modes** with better error messages:
```cpp
absl::Duration GetUserAge(absl::string_view user_name) {
  int user_id = GetUser(user_name);
  CHECK(user_id != -1) << "No user named " << user_name << " found";
  return age_map[user_id];
}
```

If you are familiar with the
[Google Logging (glog)](https://github.com/google/glog) library, these examples
will look very familiar; that project and this one share a common ancestor.  The
core macro APIs are essentially unchanged, however other interfaces like the
extension points have changed quite a bit.  While those changes aim to improve
interfaces, performance, extensibility, etc., the main reason to choose Abseil
Logging over glog is for its compatibility and integration with Abseil and with
Google's internal code now and in the future.

[Abseil Logging library documentation][abseil-logging].
