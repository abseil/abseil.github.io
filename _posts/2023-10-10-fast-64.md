Optimizing library implementations only carries us so far in making software
more efficient. In this episode, we discuss the importance of good APIs and the
right abstractions for finding optimization opportunities. As we can make the
hardware--especially with the end of Moore's Law--and software run only so fast,
the right abstractions give us continued optimization opportunities.

## Correctness is paramount

We can simplify an implementation down to `return 42;` regardless of the input
to see blazing fast results, but an API that doesn't work correctly isn't doing
its job.

"Subtle" and "clever" code has costs for both maintainers and users alike.
Today's tricky edge cases can be tomorrow's headaches when we try to optimize an
implementation. Threading the needle of preserving explicitly (or
[implicitly](https://hyrumslaw.com)) promised quirks makes the optimization
process slower and more fragile over time. Being able to
[iterate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OODA_loop) [faster](/fast/39) helps with
exploring more of the design space to find the best minima.

At times, we may need to break abstraction boundaries or have complex
preconditions to unlock the best possible performance. We need to document and
test these sharp edges. Future debugging has an opportunity cost: When we spend
time tracking down and fixing bugs, we are not developing new optimizations. We
can use assertions for preconditions, especially in debug/sanitizer builds, to
double-check contracts and *enforce* them. Testing
[robots never sleep](/fast/93), while humans are fallible. Randomized
implementation behaviors provide a useful bulwark against Hyrum's Law from
creeping in to implicitly expand the contract of an interface.

## Express intents

Small, composable operations give users flexibility to express their intents
more clearly. We can find optimizations by combining high-level but related
concepts.

Consider `memcpy` and a hypothetical `memcpy_but_faster` API that we could
build. They both express the same intent, but presumably with
[different tradeoffs around performance](/fast/52).

*   Users need to think about which one to call. This adds a cognitive cost to
    every call site. They cannot quickly reach for precisely one to realize
    their desired functionality. When in doubt, typing fewer characters is
    faster. Over time, choices made will be incorrect, either because they were
    suboptimal from the start or circumstances changed.
*   Bifurcating the API gives us two implementations, each with less usage. This
    lowers the leverage from developing optimizations to one, unless its
    maintainers can reliably cross-pollinate ideas from one to the other.
    Actively maintaining *two* implementations requires a larger investment,
    reducing the RoI from having two in the first place. Engineers may give the
    more commonly used implementation more care and attention, leading it to
    eventually outstrip the "faster" implementation.
*   Data structures and types can be especially costly to duplicate, due to the
    "[impedance mismatch](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2020/p2125r0.pdf)"
    of having a library that works solely with one type (say `std::string`) and
    another that needs a different one (`absl::my_fast_string`). In order for
    the two to interoperate, the interfaces will require expensive copies--a
    single type would not require such conversions.

While this hypothetical might seem far-fetched, this is precisely what happened
with the [predecessor implementation to `absl::popcount`](/fast/9). We had two
implementations, but the "better" one was ultimately outstripped by the "worse"
one because engineers optimized the one with the wider usage instead.

In terms of API design around intents, we can consider:

```
void* memcpy(void* dest, const void* src, size_t count);
crc32c_t absl::ComputeCrc32c(absl::string_view buf);
crc32c_t absl::MemcpyCrc32c(void* dest, const void* src, size_t count);
```

With the first two primitives, we can build a trivial, but non-optimal
implementation for the third. Combining the concepts makes sense when it is a
common operation where finer-grained operations might leave performance on the
table. Knowing we are going to both copy and checksum the bytes allows us to
read data once, rather than twice. We can decompose the implementation into its
components, as well, if that ever became more efficient.

The extra output of the operation (the `crc32c_t`) distinguishes it from just
being a `memcpy` with different performance characteristics. We would recommend
using the combined operation when we need to both *copy* data and *checksum* it.
`MemcpyCrc32c` isn't a suitable replacement for calls to `memcpy` without a need
for a checksum, which removes the cognitive cost of considering it solely for
performance reasons.

The explicit function calls can also help with understanding the purpose of the
code when we are looking at profiles later. For example, we can compare
protobufs for equality in two ways:

*   By serializing and comparing the bytes, which is unfortunately both common
    and
    [unsound](https://protobuf.dev/programming-guides/encoding/#implications).
*   [Field-by-field](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/tree/main/src/google/protobuf/util/message_differencer.h)
    directly, which is faster.

While reading a profile, we might see the individual calls to serialize and
`memcmp`, but it is harder to ascertain the intended semantics later. We may be
tempted to optimize the discrete functions--the process of serializing and
subsequent the process of comparing the resulting string. Understanding the
high-level intent and data flow gives us opportunities to optimize further up
the stack to find the "Room at the Middle", optimizing the direct comparison. At
a minimum, an optimized version could avoid holding the serialized versions in
memory.

## Avoid unnecessarily strong guarantees

There are situations where the benefits of duplicate APIs outweigh the costs.

The Abseil hash containers
([SwissMap](https://abseil.io/about/design/swisstables)) added new hashtable
implementations to the codebase, which at first glance, appear redundant with
the ones in the C++ standard library. This apparent duplication allowed us to
have a more efficient set of containers which match the standard library API,
but adhere to a weaker set of constraints.

The Abseil hash containers provided weaker guarantees for iterator and pointer
stability, allowing them to improve performance by reducing data indirections.
It is difficult to implement `std::unordered_map`'s guarantees without resorting
to a node-based implementation that requires data indirections and constrains
performance. Given `std::unordered_map`'s widespread usage, it was not feasible
to relax these guarantees all at once.

Node-based containers necessitate implementation overheads, but they come with a
direct benefit: They actively facilitate migration while allowing weaker
containers to be available. Making a guarantee stronger without an accompanying
benefit is undesirable.

The migration was a replacement path for the legacy containers, not an
alternative. The superior performance characteristics meant that users could
"just use SwissMap" without tedious benchmarking on a case-by-case basis.
There's little need for a user to revisit their decision to migrate to SwissMap
with the passage of time. This meant that usage could be actively driven towards
SwissMap: Two types would be a temporary (albeit long) state, rather than one
where every individual usage had to be carefully selected.

Years after SwissMap's development, there are far fewer--but non-zero--uses of
`std::unordered_map`. Blocking the improvement on the complete cleanup means no
benefit would have accrued. We were able to migrate instance-by-instance,
realizing incremental benefits over time.

It's important to avoid ascribing intent--even with expressive APIs--to use of a
previously predominant one. A use of `std::map` might require keys to be
ordered, but the more likely explanation might be that it is older code in need
of updating.

## Avoid leaking implementation details

Hyrum's Law reminds us that observable behaviors will be relied upon, but
sometimes our API design choices constrain our implementation details. These
often arise from returning references to data or giving fine-grained control in
APIs. This can help performance in the short-term, but care is required to make
sure it allows long-term evolution to continue to improve performance over time.

Consider protocol buffers for a simple message.

```
message MyMessage {
  optional string foo = 1;
  repeated string bar = 2;
}
```

As of October 2023, the accessor `.foo()` returns a `const std::string&`. This
*requires* that we have an in-memory representation of a `std::string` instance
that can be returned. This approach has two problems:

*   `std::string` encodes a specific allocation strategy (`std::allocator`). If
    we change the allocation strategy, for example wrapping `Arena`, we change
    the type.
*   Individual fields can have a wide range of sizes (or likelihoods of
    presence) that we can determine from profiling, which could benefit from
    variable small string object buffer sizes. Returning `const std::string&`
    constrains the implementation to that particular size of buffer.

In contrast, by returning `std::string_view` (or our
[internal predecessor](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2012/n3442.html),
`StringPiece`), we decouple callers from the internal representation. The API is
the same, independent of whether the string is constant data (backed by the
`.rodata` section), allocated on the heap by a `std::string` instance, or
allocated by an `Arena`. We've abstracted away the implementation detail from
our user, giving us more optimization freedom.

Similarly, consider the allocation-aware APIs in protobuf, `add_allocated_...`,
`release_...`, and `unsafe_arena_...`. Fine-grained control over when and where
allocations occur can offer significant performance benefits, but they also
constrain future implementations by creating sharp performance edges.

*   `release_...` allows us to remove a submessage and return ownership to the
    caller. Subobjects were heap allocated and the operation was fast--it's hard
    to beat swapping two pointers. When Protobuf Arenas became available,
    `release_...` created a new copy of the underlying message on the heap, so
    it could release that. The API couldn't convey that the returned pointer was
    owned by the Arena, not caller, so making a full copy was required to keep
    code working. As a result, code that calls `release_...` may be O(1) or O(n)
    based on non-local information (whether the source object was constructed on
    an arena)!
*   With Arenas, `unsafe_arena_...` gives us the raw hooks we need to add or
    remove fields from a message without making the copy mentioned above , with
    "unsafe" in the name conveying the subtlety and gravitas of what we're
    doing. These APIs are tricky to use correctly, though, as today's tested
    combination of arena and heap ownership may change over time and assumptions
    break. The APIs are also extremely fine-grained, but do not convey the
    higher-level intent--transferring pointer ownership, "lending" a submessage
    to another one, etc.

## Concluding remarks

Good performance should be available by default, not an optional feature. While
[feature flags and knobs can be useful for testing and initial rollout](/fast/52),
we should strive to make the right choices for users, rather than requiring
users adopt the improvement on a case-by-case basis.

Developing an optimization for an existing implementation can provide a larger
return-on-investment by targeting widespread, current usage upfront. Adding a
new API or optimization knob can be expedient, but without widespread usage and
adoption, the benefit is far more limited.

Optimization of existing code can hit stumbling blocks around unnecessarily
strong guarantees or APIs that constrain the implementation--and thus the
optimization search space--too much to find improvements.
