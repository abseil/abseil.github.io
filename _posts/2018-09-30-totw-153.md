**I view using-directives as time-bombs, both for the parties that deal in them
and the language system.** -- *Ashley Hedberg* with apologies to Warren Buffett

## tl;dr

Using-directives (`using namespace foo`) are dangerous enough to be banned by
the
[Google style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Namespaces).
Don't use them in code that will ever need to be upgraded.

If you wish to shorten a name, you may instead use a namespace alias (`namespace
baz = ::foo::bar::baz;`) or a using-declaration (`using ::foo::SomeName`), both
of which are permitted by the style guide in certain contexts (e.g. in `*.cc`
files).

## Using-directives at Function Scope

What do you think this code does?

<pre class="prettyprint lang-cpp bad-code">
namespace totw {
namespace example {
namespace {

TEST(MyTest, UsesUsingDirectives) {
  using namespace ::testing;
  Sequence seq;  // ::testing::Sequence
  WallTimer timer;  // ::WallTimer
  ...
}

}  // namespace
}  // namespace example
}  // namespace totw
</pre>

The vast majority of C++ users think that the using-directive is injecting names
into the scope where it's declared. In the example above, that would be the
scope of the function. In reality, the names are injected into the nearest
common ancestor of the target namespace (`::testing`) and the usage namespace
(`::totw::example::anonymous`) while the using directive is in scope. In our
example, **that's the global namespace**!

Thus, the code is roughly equivalent to the following:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-cpp bad-code">
using ::testing::Expectation;
using ::testing::Sequence;
using ::testing::UnorderedElementsAre;
...
// many, many more symbols are injected into the global namespace

namespace totw {
namespace example {
namespace {

TEST(MyTest, UsesUsingDirectives) {
  Sequence seq; // ::testing::Sequence
  WallTimer timer; // ::WallTimer
  ...
}

} // namespace
} // namespace example
} // namespace totw
</pre>

This transformation is not exactly correct, as the names do not actually _stay_
visible outside the scope of the using-directive. However, even a temporary
injection into the global scope has some unfortunate consequences.

Let's see what kind of changes can break this code:

*   If anyone defines `::totw::Sequence` or `::totw::example::Sequence`, `seq`
    will now refer to that entity instead of `::testing::Sequence`.

*   If anyone defines `::Sequence`, the definition of `seq` will fail to
    compile, as the reference to the name `Sequence` will be ambiguous.
    `Sequence` could mean `::testing::Sequence` or `::Sequence`, and the
    compiler doesn't know which one you wanted.

*   If anyone defines `::testing::WallTimer`, the definition of `timer` will
    fail to compile.

Thus, a single using-directive in a function scope has placed naming
restrictions on symbols in `::testing`, `::totw`, `::totw::example`, and the
global namespace. **Allowing this using-directive, even if only in function
scope, creates ample opportunities for name clashes in the global and other
namespaces.**

If that example doesn't look fragile enough, consider this:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-cpp bad-code">
namespace totw {
namespace example {
namespace {

TEST(MyTest, UsesUsingDirectives) {
  using namespace ::testing;
  EXPECT_THAT(..., proto::Partially(...)); // ::testing::proto::Partially
  ...
}

} // namespace
} // namespace example
} // namespace totw
</pre>

This using-directive has **introduced a namespace alias** `proto` in the global
namespace, roughly equivalent to the following:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-cpp bad-code">
namespace proto = ::testing::proto;

namespace totw {
namespace example {
namespace {

TEST(MyTest, UsesUsingDirectives) {
  EXPECT_THAT(..., proto::Partially(...)); // ::testing::proto::Partially
  ...
}

} // namespace
} // namespace example
} // namespace totw
</pre>

The test will keep compiling until a header defining namespace `::proto`,
`::totw::proto`, or `::totw::example::proto` gets included transitively. At that
point in time, `proto::Partially` becomes ambiguous, and the test stops
compiling. This ties into the style guide's rules on namespace naming: avoid
nested namespaces, and don't use common names for nested namespaces. (See
[Tip #130 and https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Namespace_Names
for more on this
topic.](/tips/130 and https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Namespace_Names for more on this topic.))

One might think that it's safe to employ a using-directive for a closed
namespace that has few symbols and guarantees that no more symbols will be ever
added to it. (`std::placeholders`, which contains symbols `_1` ... `_9`, is an
example of such a namespace.) However, even that isn't safe: it precludes any
other namespace from introducing symbols with the same names. In this sense,
using-directives defeat the modularity provided by namespaces.

## Unqualified using-directives

We've seen how one using-directive can go wrong. What happens if we have many of
them, unqualified, in the same codebase?

<pre class="prettyprint lang-cpp bad-code">
namespace totw {
namespace example {
namespace {

using namespace rpc;
using namespace testing;

TEST(MyTest, UsesUsingDirectives) {
  Sequence seq;  // ::testing::Sequence
  WallTimer timer;  // ::WallTimer
  RPC rpc;  // ...is this ::rpc::RPC or ::RPC?
  ...
}

}  // namespace
}  // namespace example
}  // namespace totw
</pre>

What could possibly go wrong here? A lot, as it turns out:

*   All the problems from our function-level example still exist, but two-fold:
    once for namespace `::testing`, and once for namespace `::rpc`.

*   If namespace `::rpc` and namespace `::testing` declare symbols with the same
    name, this code won't compile if it does unqualified lookup on one of those
    names. This is important, because it demonstrates a terrifying scaling
    problem: since the full contents of each namespace is (generally speaking)
    injected into the global namespace, **every new using-directive could add
    quadratic risk of name collisions and build failures.**

*   If a sub-namespace such as `::rpc::testing` is ever introduced, this code
    will stop compiling. (We have actually seen that namespace, so it is
    potentially just a matter of time until this snippet and that namespace are
    built together. Another reason to
    [avoid deeply nested namespaces](/tips/130)). The lack of namespace
    qualification is important here: this snippet may have compiled if the
    using-directives were fully-qualified *and* if there were no unqualified
    lookups on names common to both namespaces.

*   A newly-introduced symbol in `::totw::example`, `::totw`, `::testing`,
    `::rpc`, or the global namespace could collide with an existing symbol in
    _any of those namespaces_. That's a big matrix of possibilities.

A brief aside: What namespace do you think `RPC` lives in? `rpc` would have been
a perfectly reasonable guess, but it actually lives in the global namespace.
Maintainability issues aside, the using-directives here make this code hard to
read.

## Why Do We Have This Feature, Then?

There are legitimate uses of using-directives within generic libraries, but they
are so obscure and rare that they don't deserve a mention here or in the style
guide.

## Parting Words

Using-directives are time-bombs: code that compiles today could easily stop
compiling with the next language version or symbol addition. For external code
that is short-lived and whose dependencies never change, this may be an
acceptable risk. But beware: if you later decide that you want your short-lived
project to continue working _over time_, those time-bombs may explode.
