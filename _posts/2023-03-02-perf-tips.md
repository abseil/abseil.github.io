### Performance Tips of the Week

By [Alexey Alexandrov](mailto:aalexand@google.com), Google Engineer

We are pleased to announce that we've started publishing some of Google's
internal ["Performance Tips of the Week"](/fast) externally on abseil.io!

These tips form a sort of “Effective analysis and optimization of
production performance and resource usage”: a gallery of “do”s and “don’t”s
gathered from the hard-learned lessons of optimizing performance of
production systems running on machines in Google data centers.

<!--break-->

This set of tips started as an internal series at Google and it has been
hugely popular, with thousands of monthly readers and dozens of episodes
published. We are making some of these episodes available to a wider
external audience as they discuss topics that are common to the industry. 
We hope you find these tips valuable and welcome your feedback!
