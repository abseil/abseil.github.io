Abseil Python now includes a documentation set on abseil.io!

<!--break-->

Abseil Python provides various libraries for building Python applications. This
code is collected from Google's internal Python code base and has been
extensively tested and used in production. They provide features for application
startup, distributed command line flags, custom logging, and testing.

Until now, the only documentation for Abseil Python has been in the source code.
This was comprehensive but did not always provide information for new users in 
an easy-to-read format.

We're happy to announce an Abseil
[Python Quickstart Guide](/docs/python/quickstart) and module-specific
[programming guides](/docs/python/guides/)  similar to those for Abseil C++.
These guides are patterned after those used internally at Google to onboard new
Googlers (nooglers), and we hope they will be similarly helpful to you!
