"I cannot contain myself" -- Bertrand Russell

## Does That Container Contain This Thing or Not?

When checking whether a set contains a value or a map contains a key, C++ has
historically forced users to choose between writing the rather verbose

<pre class="prettyprint lang-cpp code">
container.find(value) != container.end()
</pre>

or the arguably obtuse (and sometimes inefficient)

<pre class="prettyprint lang-cpp code">
container.count(value) != 0
</pre>

instead of writing

<pre class="prettyprint lang-cpp code">
container.contains(value)
</pre>

as we'd like to.

## <code>container.contains(value)</code> to the Rescue

The simpler syntax is part of the C++20 Standard, and Abseilâ€™s
<!-- [hashed containers][hashmaps] --> (`absl::{flat,node}_hash_{map,set}`) and
btree containers (`absl::btree_*`) support it today.

`contains` has the same support for [heterogeneous lookup](/tips/144) as `find`,
so (for example) it's possible to check whether an
`absl::flat_hash_set<std::string>` contains an `absl::string_view` value without
paying the costs of converting to a `std::string` object:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-cpp code">
constexpr absl::string_view name = "Willard Van Orman Quine";
absl::flat_hash_set&lt;std::string&gt; names = {std::string(name)};
assert(names.contains(name));  // No dynamic allocation here.
</pre>

Given that most of our code that needs associative containers (whether sets or
maps) should be using the Abseil hashed containers today (see
[Tip #136](/tips/136)), it should rarely be necessary to use one of the other
formulations in new code.

NOTE: As described in [Tip #132](/tips/132) ("Avoid Redundant Map Lookups"),
don't check if an item is in a container and then do another operation that
implies a lookup (such as `find`, `insert` or `remove`).

## Conclusion

Querying whether an item can be found in an associative container is a common
operation, and a natural syntax for it is `container.contains(value)`. Prefer
that syntax when possible.
