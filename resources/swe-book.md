## Software Engineering at Google

In March, 2020, we published a book titled "Software Engineering at Google"
curated by Titus Winters, Tom Manshreck and Hyrum Wright.

The Software Engineering at Google book ("SWE Book") is not about programming,
per se, but about the engineering practices utilized at Google to make their
codebase sustainable and healthy. (These practices are paramount for common
infrastructural code such as Abseil.)

We are happy to announce that we are providing a digital version of this book
in HTML free of charge. Of course, we encourage you to get yourself a hard copy
from O'Reilly if you wish.
