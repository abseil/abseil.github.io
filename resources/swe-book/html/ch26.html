<h1>Afterword</h1>

<p>Software engineering at Google has been an extraordinary experiment in how to develop and maintain a large and evolving codebase. <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="software engineering" data-secondary="concluding thoughts" data-type="indexterm" id="ix_sftengrcl">&nbsp;</a>I’ve seen engineering teams break ground on this front during my time here, moving Google forward both as a company that touches billions of users and as a leader in the tech industry. This wouldn’t have been possible without the principles outlined in this book, so I’m very excited to see these pages come to life.</p>

<p>If the past 50 years (or the preceding pages here) have proven anything, it’s that software engineering is far from stagnant. In an environment in which technology is steadily changing, the software engineering function holds a particularly important role within a given organization. Today, software engineering principles aren’t simply about how to effectively run an organization; they’re about how to be a more responsible company for users and the world at large.</p>

<p>Solutions to common software engineering problems are not always hidden in plain sight—most require a certain level of resolute agility to identify solutions that will work for current-day problems and also withstand inevitable changes to technical systems. This agility is a common quality of the software engineering teams I’ve had the privilege to work with and learn from since joining Google back in 2008.</p>

<p>The idea of sustainability is also central to software engineering. Over a codebase’s expected lifespan, we must be able to react and adapt to changes, be that in product direction, technology platforms, underlying libraries, operating systems, and more. Today, we rely on the principles outlined in this book to achieve crucial flexibility in changing pieces of our software ecosystem.</p>

<p>We certainly can’t prove that the ways we’ve found to attain sustainability will work for every organization, but I think it’s important to share these key learnings. Software engineering is a new discipline, so very few organizations have had the chance to achieve both sustainability and scale. By providing this overview of what we’ve seen, as well as the bumps along the way, our hope is to demonstrate the value and feasibility of long-term planning for code health. The passage of time and the importance of change cannot be ignored.</p>

<p>This book outlines some of our key guiding principles as they relate to software engineering. At a high level, it also illuminates the influence of technology on society. As software engineers, it’s our responsibility to ensure that our code is designed with inclusion, equity, and accessibility for everyone. Building for the sole purpose of innovation is no longer acceptable; technology that helps only a set of users isn’t innovative at all.</p>

<p>Our responsibility at Google has always been to provide developers, internally and externally, with a well-lit path. With the rise of new technologies like artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and ambient computing, there’s still plenty for us to learn as a company. I’m particularly excited to see where the industry takes software engineering in the coming years, and I’m confident that this book will help shape that path.<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="software engineering" data-secondary="concluding thoughts" data-startref="ix_sftengrcl" data-type="indexterm" id="id-kZsmH0hn">&nbsp;</a></p>
