## C++ Tips of the Week

Background: About five years ago, within Google we started publishing a series 
of C++ tips, about once a week, that became known as the "C++ Tips of the Week"
(TotW). They became wildly successful, and we are still publishing them to
this day (indicating that a language as rich as C++ will not deplete us of
topics anytime soon).

Not only do we discuss the finer points of the language, but in true "tip"
fashion, offer our advice or design preferences. The collective set of C++
TotW has become a canon within Google itself, cited thousands of times per
week in code reviews and internal mailing list discussions. Often they are
cited by number, and some have become known simply as "totw/110" or "totw/77". 

We've decided to expose most of these tips to the Abseil development community,
and the C++ community at large. Over the coming months, we'll be posting new
tips as we review and refine them for publication. Not all the entries we've
written are relevant to the outside world; some were 
specific to our internal tools and abstractions, and some have become obsolete 
as the language has changed. But we'll publish what we can and what we find
valuable (and write new tips!) on this page as they become available.

Note: we will be keeping the original numbering scheme on these tips, and 
original publication date, so that the 12K or so people that have some exposure
to the original numbering don't have to learn new citations. As a result, some
tips may appear missing and/or  out of order to a casual reader. But rest 
assured, we're giving you the good stuff.

* [TotW #1 string_view](totw/1) - Overview of absl::string_view and how to use
  it in APIs
* [TotW #122 - Test Fixtures, Clarity, and Dataflow](totw/122) - Design
  suggestions for tests and test fixtures to improve clarity.
